# Understanding the Carbon Footprint of AI: Computing and Applications

Professor Chen: Hello Jamie, welcome to today's discussion on understanding the carbon footprint of artificial intelligence. As AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives and global infrastructure, it's crucial we understand not just their capabilities, but also their environmental impact.

Jamie: Thanks, Professor Chen. I've been hearing a lot about AI recently, but I haven't thought much about its environmental impact. Isn't it just software? How can code have a carbon footprint?

Professor Chen: That's a great starting question! While AI is indeed software, running that software requires significant computing power, which consumes electricity. The carbon footprint comes primarily from two sources: the operational energy used to power the computations and the embodied emissions from manufacturing the hardware.

Jamie: I see. So we're talking about the electricity used by computers running AI systems. But is it really that significant compared to other sources of emissions?

Professor Chen: The ICT sector as a whole accounts for about 1.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and AI is a growing part of that. To understand AI's impact specifically, we need to look at the lifecycle of an AI model, which has three main stages: inference, training, and development.

Jamie: Could you explain those stages? I'm not familiar with those terms in this context.

Professor Chen: Of course. Think of it like learning to play a musical instrument. Inference is like performing a piece you've already learned—it's when an AI model is actually being used, like when your phone recognizes your face or translates text. This requires the least energy per run but happens very frequently.

Training is like practicing a piece until you master it—it's teaching the AI model to perform its task by analyzing data. This requires more energy than inference but happens less often.

Development is like a composer trying many different variations before settling on the final piece—it's researchers experimenting with different model architectures and parameters. This is the most energy-intensive stage and can involve thousands of training runs.

Jamie: That makes sense. Which stage contributes most to the overall carbon footprint?

Professor Chen: It depends on the use case. For widely deployed models like those running on billions of smartphones, inference can collectively consume more energy than training. But for cutting-edge research models, the development phase can be extremely energy-intensive. In the most extreme cases, developing certain large AI models can produce emissions comparable to the lifetime carbon emissions of a car.

Jamie: Wow, that's a lot! Are all AI models that energy-hungry?

Professor Chen: No, there's huge variation. Many AI applications use relatively simple models that can run on a laptop with minimal energy. It's the large deep learning models, especially those used for complex tasks like language processing or computer vision, that require significant computing resources.

Jamie: Where does all this computation actually happen?

Professor Chen: Most AI workloads today run in large data centers, which house thousands of specialized computers. These data centers account for about 0.1-0.2% of global GHG emissions. Cloud and hyperscale data centers have become more energy-efficient over time, which has helped limit emissions growth despite the explosion in computing demand.

Jamie: Are there ways to reduce the carbon footprint of these computations?

Professor Chen: Absolutely! There are several approaches. First, making the algorithms themselves more efficient through techniques like model compression or using simpler models when possible. Second, improving hardware efficiency with specialized AI accelerator chips. Third, running computations in regions with cleaner electricity or at times when renewable energy is abundant. And finally, increasing the use of renewable energy to power data centers.

Jamie: That makes me wonder—can AI itself help address climate change, or is it just part of the problem?

Professor Chen: That's a great question! AI is a double-edged sword for climate change. On the positive side, AI can enable or accelerate climate solutions in numerous ways. For example, it can improve forecasting of renewable energy production, optimize heating and cooling systems in buildings, accelerate the discovery of new battery materials, and help track deforestation through satellite imagery.

Jamie: Those applications sound really beneficial. But you mentioned a double-edged sword?

Professor Chen: Yes, because AI can also be used in ways that increase emissions. For instance, AI has been used to accelerate oil and gas exploration by decreasing production costs. It's also used to manage large-scale cattle farming, which is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. And because AI is a general-purpose technology, it can make many economic activities more efficient, which could lead to higher consumption and potentially higher emissions.

Jamie: That makes sense. So the impact really depends on how we choose to apply the technology.

Professor Chen: Precisely. And beyond these immediate applications, there are also what we call "system-level impacts." These are broader societal changes that AI might enable that could affect emissions positively or negatively.

Jamie: What kind of system-level impacts are we talking about?

Professor Chen: One example is what economists call "rebound effects." If AI makes a service more efficient and therefore cheaper, people might use more of that service, potentially negating the efficiency gains. For instance, autonomous vehicles could improve fuel efficiency, but they might also lead to more people driving longer distances because it's more convenient.

Another system-level impact involves "path dependencies" or "lock-in." AI might entrench certain technologies or behaviors that have climate implications. For example, AI-enabled autonomous vehicles might further cement our dependence on individual cars rather than more efficient mass transit systems.

Jamie: That's fascinating—it sounds like the indirect effects could be even more significant than the direct energy use. How can we ensure AI is deployed in ways that help rather than hinder climate action?

Professor Chen: That's where policy and corporate action come in. There are many levers we can use to align AI with climate goals. For example, economy-wide carbon pricing would encourage both efficient AI systems and applications that reduce emissions. 

On the public policy side, governments can support research in energy-efficient AI, require transparent reporting of AI's carbon footprint, and provide incentives for beneficial AI applications. They can also employ climate-cognizant technology assessment when regulating AI-driven emerging technologies.

Jamie: What about companies that develop and deploy AI? What can they do?

Professor Chen: Companies can adopt organizational carbon pricing strategies, make energy efficiency a central criterion in model development, shift computing to times and locations with cleaner electricity, and adjust their business models to focus on applications that reduce emissions rather than increase them.

They can also increase transparency about the carbon footprint of their AI systems and invest in improving hardware efficiency and renewable energy.

Jamie: Is anyone measuring and reporting on AI's carbon footprint today?

Professor Chen: It's still relatively uncommon, but the practice is growing. There are tools like CodeCarbon and CarbonTracker that can estimate the energy use and carbon emissions of training AI models. Some research papers now include emissions information, and conferences like NeurIPS have started requesting that submissions report their emissions.

However, we're still lacking standardized methodologies and comprehensive data, especially when it comes to assessing the system-level impacts of AI applications.

Jamie: This all seems quite complex. Are you optimistic that we can harness AI for climate benefits while minimizing its negative impacts?

Professor Chen: I believe we can, but it won't happen automatically. With the rapidly growing prevalence of AI and the increasing urgency of climate change, we have a critical window of opportunity to shape AI's impacts for decades to come. This will require thoughtful policy, corporate leadership, and cooperation between the AI and climate communities.

The ultimate effect of AI on climate isn't predestined—it will be determined by the choices we make as a society about how to develop and deploy these powerful technologies.

Jamie: Thank you, Professor Chen. This conversation has really opened my eyes to the environmental dimensions of AI. I'll definitely be thinking more about the carbon footprint of the technologies I use and support.

Professor Chen: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm glad this was valuable for you. Remember that as AI continues to evolve, so too will our understanding of its environmental impacts and the strategies we can use to mitigate them. Staying informed and asking these kinds of questions is exactly what we need to ensure AI serves our broader societal goals, including addressing climate change.
