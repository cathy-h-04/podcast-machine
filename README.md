- Hugging Face API token (for cover art generation)
- Tavus API credentials (for video conference)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-yap.git
cd claude-yap
```

2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create .env file using example template
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your API keys in the .env file
```

3. Set up the frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

2. Start the frontend development server

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React with React Router
- Framer Motion for animations
- Advanced HTML5 audio player
